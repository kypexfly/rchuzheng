          My passion for web development began when I was adolescence, experimenting with HTML and CSS in my spare time.
          Since then, I have honed my skills in JavaScript and its frameworks. I thrive on solving complex problems and
          creating visually appealing user interfaces. I believe in the power of technology to make a positive impact on
          the world, and I&apos;m excited to be part of this dynamic and ever-evolving industry.
