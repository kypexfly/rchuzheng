        I am a 23-year-old graduate student in Electrical Engineering. From a young age, I have been fascinated by the
        intricacies of web development, exploring programming languages such as Javascript, Python, and utilizing tools
        like MATLAB/R for scientific and engineering applications.

        I have managed graphic design communities for over 5 years. Throughout my career, conducted research projects on
        topics such as the sizing of residential photovoltaic systems and analyzing the harmonics of electric vehicles
        in distribution networks. I have a strong passion for learning and am always seeking new knowledge and
        experiences.
