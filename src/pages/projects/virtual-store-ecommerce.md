## About epic7index

This is an Epic Seven fan made webside using [EpicSevenDB](https://api.epicsevendb.com/) API as source of information and inspired on [epic7x](https://epic7x.com/), [epicsevendb](https://epicsevendb.com/) and [epic7stats](https://www.epic7stats.com/).
Implemented with React.js library.

## Know issues

* Public filter in Artifacts is not working.
* API is giving different element/class/sign names, ie. manauser = soul weaver, twin = gemini, etc.
* Filtering heroes and artifacts feels slow. Needs optimization.
