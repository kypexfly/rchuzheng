## Reading other people's code

Reading other people's code can help you learn new techniques, patterns, and ways of solving problems. This can be achieved, for example, by reviewing library and project repositories on GitHub. When reading other developers' code, it's important to focus on understanding the reasoning behind the design and implementation decisions they made. This helps us understand how a problem can be solved efficiently and effectively.

## Reviewing your old projects

By reviewing your old projects, you can identify the strengths and weaknesses of your code, which can help you improve as a developer. For example, you might realize that you always use the same structure to solve certain problems or that you tend to repeat code in different parts of your project.

It's important to remember that, as developers, we are constantly learning new skills and tools. By reviewing old projects, we can identify areas where we can apply them.

## Separating code when necessary

Code organization can be very important for code readability and maintainability, but it's also important to not overdo it and maintain simplicity in the structure. By finding a balance between these two ideas, we can develop clear and well-organized code that is easy to understand and maintain.

For example, sometimes separating code into different files and folders can slow down the workflow, especially when the code is small and only used in one place, unless its reusability is carefully considered.

## Consistency above all

Consistency is a fundamental principle of programming that refers to following a set of consistent conventions and design patterns throughout the code. Consistent code is easy to read and understand, making it easier to maintain and modify in the future.

Consistency can be applied to many aspects of the code, such as file structure, variable naming, indentation, and coding style.
