"Refactoring UI" is not a book in itself, but it is a popular online resource created by **Adam Wathan** and **Steve Schoger**,
who are well-known for their expertise in web design and user interface (UI) design.

The primary focus of "Refactoring UI" is to teach designers and developers how to improve the visual design of their user interfaces.
It covers a wide range of practical tips, techniques, and best practices for making UIs that look polished and professional.
